1. Use Python 3. Enter 'pip install Pygments' in console to install Pygments package.
2. In TeXStudio, go to Options -> Configure TeXStudio -> Build -> User Commands (below)
	-> Add user command: Name: user:graphviz-pdflatex Command:txs:///pdflatex/[--shell-escape].
	This is to invoke -shell-escape in LaTex
3. In TeXStudio, go to Tools -> User -> Find the comman with name 'user:graphviz-pdflatex', run it to build the file (or remember the shortcut
	of this command for future use)
4. If the error 'Package minted Error: You must have `pygmentize' installed to use this package. \begin{document}' shows up, this means the
	Pygmentize.exe is not in the default PATH variable in the system of the computer. To solve this:
	i. Go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings (on the left) -> Advanced (above tab)
		-> Environment Variables (below) -> In System variables, find the variable 'PATH' -> Edit, check out what is the specific
		path of the PATH variable
	ii. Go to the folder where Anaconda (including pygmentize.exe) is installed, find the package pygmentize.exe,
		in the current laptop, it is ...(disk and folder of Anaconda)/Anaconda/Scripts/pygmentize.exe (Or just go to the disk where
		Anaconda is installed, search pygmentize.exe, and it will show up with its location of install)
	iii. Copy pygmentize.exe, go to the folder specified by the PATH variable found in step i., paste it there, and run LaTex with minted
		using the user command set in step 3.
